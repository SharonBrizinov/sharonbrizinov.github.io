## About Me

<img class="profile-picture" src="avatar.png">

Hello! I'm Sharon Brizinov, a security researcher with more than [200 CVEs](https://sharonbrizinov.com/cves). I specialize in vulnerability research and OT/IoT security. I've presented my research in many conferences including DEFCON, BlackHat, BlueHatIL, HITCON, SANS, and more. I also contribute code to open-source projects, see my [GitHub page](https://github.com/sharonbrizinov).

I also participated in Pwn2Own five times including [ICS 2020](https://www.zerodayinitiative.com/blog/2020/1/21/pwn2own-miami-2020-schedule-and-live-results), [ICS 2022](https://www.zerodayinitiative.com/blog/2022/4/14/pwn2own-miami-2022-results), [IoT 2022](https://www.zerodayinitiative.com/blog/2022/12/5/pwn2own-toronto-2022-day-one-results),[ICS 2023](https://www.zerodayinitiative.com/blog/2023/2/16/pwn2own-miami-2023-day-three-results), [IoT 2023](https://www.zerodayinitiative.com/blog/2023/10/26/pwn2own-toronto-2023-day-three-results), got SANS Institue [Researcher-of-the-Year Award](https://twitter.com/SANSInstitute/status/1605205777093984260) and won DEFCON 27's ICS CTF, earning a [DEFCON black badge](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-black-badge.html).

I found vulnerabilities in major companies and products such as:
* ICS: Siemens, GE, Rockwell Automation, ABB, Emerson, Honeywell, Schneider Electric, and others.
* IoT: Qualcomm, Synology, Western Digital, Netgear, TP-Link, and others.
* Misc: Wireshark, Splunk, BusyBox, and others.
* BugBounty: Meta, AWS, Microsoft, Yahoo, Adobe, Shopify, and others.
