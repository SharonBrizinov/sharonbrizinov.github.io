## About Me

<img class="profile-picture" src="avatar.png">

Hi! My name is Sharon Brizinov and I’m a security researcher. I specialize with vulnerability research and ICS/SCADA security. You can check most of the vulnerabilities I have found [here](https://sharonbrizinov.com/cves).
In addition, I’m a practitioner of CTFs, took part of Pwn2Own 2020 and won the DEFCON 27’s ICS CTF and earned a [DEFCON black badge](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-black-badge.html).

Besides security research, I also like to develop mobile applications and games. You can find most of my projects on [GitHub](https://github.com/sharonbrizinov).
