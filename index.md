## About Me

<img class="profile-picture" src="avatar.png">

Hello! I'm Sharon Brizinov, a security researcher. I specialize in vulnerability research and ICS/SCADA security. Most of the vulnerabilities I have found can be found [here](https://sharonbrizinov.com/cves).
In addition, I've participated in [Pwn2Own 2020](https://www.zerodayinitiative.com/blog/2020/1/21/pwn2own-miami-2020-schedule-and-live-results) and won DEFCON 27's ICS CTF, earning a [DEFCON black badge](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-black-badge.html).


Besides security research, I also like to develop mobile applications and games. You can find most of my projects on [GitHub](https://github.com/sharonbrizinov).
